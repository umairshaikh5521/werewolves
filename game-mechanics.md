## Game Overview

**Moonrise** is a real-time, multiplayer social deduction game where players are secretly assigned roles as either **Villagers** (good team), **Werewolves** (evil team), or **Neutral** roles. The game alternates between **Night** and **Day** phases, where players use their abilities and vote to eliminate opponents.

### Core Objective
- **Village Team:** Eliminate all werewolves
- **Werewolf Team:** Equal or outnumber the villagers

### Game Limits
- **Player Range:** 5-12 players
- **Maximum Rounds:** 10 rounds (1 round = Night → Day → Voting)
- **Round Limit Behavior:** If 10 rounds are reached, the game ends. The Werewolves win if they equal or outnumber the Villagers (ties favor Werewolves).

---

## Teams & Win Conditions

### 🛡️ Village Team (Good)
**Roles:** Villager, Seer, Doctor, Gunner, Detective, Hunter

**Win Condition:**  
Eliminate all werewolves (all players with `team: 'bad'`)

**Victory Triggers:**
- Last werewolf is eliminated during voting
- Last werewolf is shot by the Gunner

---

### 🐺 Werewolf Team (Evil)
**Roles:** Werewolf, Kitten Wolf, Shadow Wolf

**Win Condition:**  
Equal or outnumber non-werewolf players

**Victory Triggers:**
- After night phase resolution: `wolves.length >= nonWolves.length`
- After voting phase resolution: `wolves.length >= nonWolves.length`
- After Hunter revenge: `wolves.length >= nonWolves.length`
- After Revenant ability: `wolves.length >= nonWolves.length`

**Important Notes:**
- Converted players (bitten by Kitten Wolf) count as werewolves
- The Jester (neutral) has been removed in favor of the Revenant
- The Revenant counts as a non-werewolf for win condition purposes (until they absorb a wolf role)

---

- Vote during voting phase
- Help identify werewolves through deduction
- Share intel if you receive a System AI alert

**Strategic Notes:**
- Most common role, but now has occasional intel
- Voting power is crucial
- If you get a System AI alert, you know *something* happened at a target player, but not *what*. Use this to cross-reference claims (e.g., if someone claims "I was attacked but saved", and you saw activity at their house, it matches).

---

## Special Mechanics

### Conversion System (Kitten Wolf Bite)

**Conversion Process:**
1. Kitten Wolf selects target and uses bite
2. Target must be `team: 'good'` (cannot convert neutral or bad)
3. Target's properties updated:
   ```javascript
   {
     role: 'wolf',
     team: 'bad',
     roleData: undefined, // Original role data removed
     wasConverted: true,
     convertedAtTurn: currentTurn
   }
   ```
4. Converted player immediately joins wolf team
5. Converted player gains access to wolf chat
6. Kitten Wolf's `hasBitten` flag set to `true` (cannot bite again)

**Conversion Rules:**
- Cannot convert werewolves
- Conversion does NOT trigger Hunter revenge
- Converted player knows they were converted
- Seer will see converted player as werewolf
- Detective will see converted player as werewolf team
- No death occurs on conversion night

**Strategic Impact:**
- Converting Seer removes village's information source
- Converting Doctor removes village's protection
- Converting Gunner removes village's day kill ability
- Timing is crucial - early conversion vs. saving for key moment

---

### Mute System (Shadow Wolf)

**Mute Application:**
1. Shadow Wolf selects target at night (or skips)
2. At night resolution, old mutes cleared
3. New mute applied: `target.isMuted = true`
4. Mute lasts entire following day phase
5. Mute cleared at start of next night

**Mute Effects:**
- Muted player cannot send messages in village chat
- Muted player CAN send messages in wolf chat (if werewolf)
- Muted player CAN vote during voting phase
- UI shows mute indicator to muted player
- Other players see muted player's silence

**Mute Restrictions:**
- Cannot mute fellow werewolves
- Cannot mute dead players
- Must mute or skip each night

**Skip Mute Mechanic:**
- Shadow Wolf can choose not to mute
- Must submit `skipMute` action for early night end
- `skipMute` action recorded with self as target

---

### Hunter Revenge System

**Trigger Detection:**
1. Hunter death detected during phase resolution
2. Game state updated:
   ```javascript
   {
     phase: 'hunter_revenge',
     phaseEndTime: now + 20000,
     hunterRevengePlayerId: hunterId,
     previousPhase: 'night' | 'voting' | 'day'
   }
   ```
3. System message sent to all players
4. 20-second timer starts

**Hunter Action:**
- Hunter UI shows all alive players
- Hunter selects target
- Selection submits `revenge` action
- Immediate phase transition triggered

**Revenge Resolution:**
1. Check for revenge action in actions table
2. If action exists: Kill target, send message
3. If no action: "Hunter's aim falters... no shot was fired"
4. Clear `hunterRevengePlayerId` and `previousPhase`
5. Check win condition
6. Transition to appropriate next phase based on `previousPhase`

**Phase Routing:**
- `previousPhase: 'night'` → Day Phase
- `previousPhase: 'voting'` → Night Phase (next turn)
- `previousPhase: 'day'` → Voting Phase

---

### Early Phase End System

**Night Phase Early End:**
Triggers when ALL of the following are true:
- All alive werewolves (including converted) have submitted kill votes
- Shadow Wolf (if alive) has submitted BOTH a kill vote AND a mute/skipMute action
- Seer (if alive) has submitted scan
- Doctor (if alive) has submitted save
- Detective (if alive) has submitted investigation
- Kitten Wolf (if alive) has submitted kill OR convert

**Voting Phase Early End:**
- Triggers immediately when all alive players have cast a vote

---

### Game Reset & Cleanup

**Reset Function:**
- Host can trigger `resetToLobby` from the end screen
- **Effects:**
  - Clears all player roles, teams, and statuses
  - Wipes all game actions and chat history
  - Resets turn counter to 0
  - Sets game status back to `lobby`
  - Keeps players in the room (doesn't kick them)
- **Host Status:** The player who resets remains the host

**Implementation:**
- After each action submission, check conditions
- If conditions met, schedule immediate phase transition
- `scheduler.runAfter(0, transitionPhase, ...)`

---

### Round Limit System

**Maximum Rounds:** 10

**Limit Check:**
- Checked after voting phase resolution
- Checked after Hunter revenge (if from voting)

**Limit Reached Behavior:**
1. Count alive wolves: `wolves = alive.filter(p => p.team === 'bad')`
2. Count alive non-wolves: `nonWolves = alive.filter(p => p.team !== 'bad')`
3. Determine winner:
   - If `wolves.length >= nonWolves.length` → Werewolves win
   - Otherwise → Village wins
4. Set game status:
   ```javascript
   {
     status: 'ended',
     winningTeam: winner,
     endReason: 'Maximum rounds (10) reached'
   }
   ```

---

### Win Condition Checking

**Check Timing:**
- After night phase resolution
- After voting phase resolution
- After Hunter revenge resolution
- After Gunner shot (if kills last wolf)

**Win Condition Logic:**
```javascript
function checkWinCondition(players) {
  const alive = players.filter(p => p.isAlive)
  const wolves = alive.filter(p => p.team === 'bad')
  const nonWolves = alive.filter(p => p.team !== 'bad')
  
  if (wolves.length === 0) return 'good'  // Village wins
  if (wolves.length >= nonWolves.length) return 'bad'  // Werewolves win
  return null  // Game continues
}
```

**Special Cases:**

- Round 10 reached → Force winner determination
- Converted players count as werewolves

---

## Chaos Mode

Chaos Mode is a special game variant that adds unpredictability and humor to the standard werewolf experience. It is toggleable by the host in the lobby.

### Features

#### 1. Identities & Renaming
- All players are assigned random **Indian Meme Names** (e.g., *Baburao, Chintu, Majnu Bhai, Crime Master Gogo*).
- Real player names are hidden during gameplay to create confusion.
- Players can see their own Chaos Identity in their role overlay (and by clicking their role pill).

#### 2. Desi System Messages
- Standard game notifications are replaced with **Hindi slang and Bollywood dialogues**.
- **Night Start:** *"Raat ho gayi! Sab so jao varna Gabbar aa jayega!"*
- **Death:** *"Tata, Goodbye, Khatam! [Player] gaya kaam se!"*
- **Hunter Shot:** *"Patt se Headshot! [Player] finish!"*
- **Survival:** *"Koi to Maut ko chhuke tak se wapas aa gaya!"*

#### 3. System Glitch Reveal (The "Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate" Mechanic)
- **Trigger:** Random chance (25%) at the start of each Day Phase.
- **Effect:** The System "accidentally" leaks a player's role in Global Chat.
- **Reliability:** The revealed role is **NOT GUARANTEED TO BE TRUE**. It selects a random role from the pool, so it might be a valid leak or a complete lie to cause panic.
- **Frequency:** Happens only once per game.
- **Message:** *"⚠️ SYSTEM GLITCH: [Player] ka role leak ho gaya! Wo pakka [Role] hai... shayad..."*
